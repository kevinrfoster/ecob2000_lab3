*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an identical computer file to the rest of your study group. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*


1. What are the names of the people in your study group?
2. Write up the results of your k-nn lab work. Explain each step. Highlight some interesting things that you discovered! Start to think about the homework as not just a big dump of output but instead first give curated highlights. (You can append the output dump)
